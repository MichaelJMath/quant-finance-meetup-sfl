# Quant Finance Meetup of South Florida 

## Google Group Forum Guidelines

 1) Be respectful and courteous of others.
 3) No Spam<br>
    - It is okay to link to other products, services, meetups, etc., that you genuinely think could be helpful to the group. 
    - Just please use your good judgement. 
 2) Quality of posts is valued over quantity. 
 3) If posting code in the group, please use the [guidelines below](#how-to-post-code-in-the-group). 
    - This is important because posting code in plain text can be hard to read.
 4) Adding tags when creating a new topic is recommended.

## Suggested Topics for Posts

## How to Post Code in the Group
Google Groups does not have the best code syntax highlighting functionality. However, here are some recommended ways to post code in the group:<br>

#### Method 1 
  - Post code on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) or [Gist.GitHub.com](https://gist.github.com/). Then post the link into the group with an associated message describing your purpose for posting.<br>
    - This is the recommended method if you have large amounts of code and or multiple files in your source code. 
    - It also allows you post a sample of any external data sources you might be using (e.g. a .csv file). This can make it easier for someone to help you.
#### Method 2
  - Copy and paste your code into a code syntax highlighter. Then copy and paste that output directly into the Google Group post.
    1) Copy and paste your code into one of the following code syntax highlighting sites: [https://tohtml.com/](https://tohtml.com/), [http://pygments.org/](http://pygments.org/), [http://hilite.me/](http://hilite.me/)
    2) Select your language (e.g. Python). (Note: On Pygments.org, you also have to add an arbitrary Code description.)
    3) Click highlight
    4) Copy and paste the output code directly into the group.
#### Method 3
   - You can try copying and pasting directly from your code editor. However, I found that it does not work from Jupyter Notebooks (such as those used in Quantopian) or editors with dark backgrounds.
